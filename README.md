# deck.gl + react-map-gl + GeoJSON

This is based off the [GeoJSON example in the deck.gl repo](https://github.com/uber/deck.gl/blob/master/examples/geojson/app.js)

This is the second attempt [I wrote about](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/silver-saxophone?path=README.md:11:0)

The GeoJSON file is ~30k but there are ~3 sec pauses in `getImageData` ![this timeline](https://cdn.glitch.com/eb8c029b-6783-4bcd-87fe-df6b46584e00%2Freminiscent-glue.glitch.me-timeline.png?1508781957386)
